The main goal of MAYAA is not to grow too fast! <br>
We strive to consolidate the work which is currently already done: <br>
- Improve our capacity to sponsor a child up to his school graduation + help him to get a post
graduate certificate or Professional training. <br>
- Based on actions already undertaken elsewhere, develop similar educational support to
underprivileged children in Hong Kong. <br>
- Help to improve local school facilities where these may be lacking, such as extra library
books, additional computers … <br>
- Ensure that children receive at least one balanced meal per day. Either by providing the
meal or sponsoring within the school catering structure. <br>
- To identify children and families in need by working closely with the school authorities, and
school teachers. <br>
- Identify children in need educationally and provide extracurricular teaching to give them
that extra help to keep up.
